Vocationally speaking, I have spent the last 6 years of my life championing the cause of the customer. I want to make products that customers enjoy using, and I want to be part of a team that loves what they do.

The rebranding and relaunch of the consumer CrashPlan properties last year were inspiring to see. Contributing to a high-talent, high-performance team that's already creating gorgeous and functional sites would be incredibly energizing. There is still work to be done; aligning the PRO and PROe web properties with current branding, and continuing to be a leader in our industry is something I want to be a part of.</p><div class=circle><img src=images/f680aeb1.lightbulb.png></div><p><b>I enjoy working hard and learning new things.</b><br>Being a highly self-motivated person, I'm not afraid of a challenge. A job that doesn't push you to your limits and stretch your capabilities isn't worth having. I program because I enjoy it, and am frequently and intentionally exposing myself to new things, not simply doing enough to get by. I want to be challenged and inspired every day.</p></div></div></div><div id=skills><div class=wrapper><div class=container><h1>Skills/Qualifications</h1><div id=html-css class=skill-div><img src=images/6acfec86.paint-roller.png><h3>HTML/CSS</h3><ul><li>Preprocessor Experience -- SASS/Compass</li><li>Scaffolding/Workflow Tools -- Yeoman, Grunt, Bower</li><li>Templating -- Twitter Bootstrap, HTML5 Boilerplate, Skeleton</li></ul></div><div id=javascript class=skill-div><img src=images/98eb7d6c.wrench.png><h3>JavaScript</h3><ul><li>jQuery</li><li>Backbone & Underscore -- Familiar with MVC design pattern; excited to<br>learn Angular/Ember/others as needed</li><li>Testing -- Mocha</li><li>APIs -- REST, JSON</li></ul></div><div id=collaboration class=skill-div><div class=skill-category><img src=images/d8a7db5d.connect.png><h3>Versioning/Collaboration</h3></div><ul><li>Git</li><li>GitHub -- Comfortable making pull requests, merging code, resolving<br>conflicts and collaborating</li></ul></div></div></div></div><div id=contact><div class=wrapper><div class=spacer></div><div class=container><h2>I would love to talk!</h2><p>I'm excited about this opportunity, and hope we can connect soon.</p><div class=soc-med-div><a href=mailto:jjwielgus@gmail.com><img src=images/5a013af0.email-icon.png> <span>jjwielgus@gmail.com</span></a></div><div class=soc-med-div><a href=https://github.com/Gloryofthe80s target=_blank><img src=images/3ccf2c53.github-icon.png> <span>GloryOfThe80s</span></a></div><div class=soc-med-div><a href=https://twitter.com/jjwielgus target=_blank><img src=images/e3929dc6.twitter-icon.png> <span>@jjwielgus</span></a></div><div class=soc-med-div><a href=http://gloryoftheeighties.wordpress.com target=_blank><img src=images/3894a7c9.wordpress-icon.png> <span>GloryOfThe80s</span></a></div></div><div class=spacer></div></div></div></div><script src=scripts/a0ad72f1.vendor.js></script><script src=scripts/aaf74903.plugins.js></script><script src=scripts/e46a123f.main.js></script>
